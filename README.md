# Image in a scroll view with auto layout in iOS in Swift

This is a demo iOS app written in Swift that shows how to use image inside a scroll view with auto layout.

Image can be panned and zoomed. It is centered and zoomed out initially. Adapts to device orientation change with animation.

This repository replaces previous [objective-c version](https://github.com/evgenyneu/ios-imagescroll).

Tested in iOS 7.1 and 8.0.

## Things to note

* The job is done with auto layout constraints only.
* On each zoom we update the `constant` values for the constraints to center the image if needed.
* Feel free to contact me if you are stuck (like I was).

## How to copy this control to your project

* In your storyboard 'Use Autolayout' setting must enabled.
* Copy files `ImageScrollViewController.m` and `ImageScrollViewController.h` into your project.
* Copy Image Scroll View Controller into your storyboard, like this:

## Troubleshooting

Please make sure:

* Your view controller's class is ImageScrollViewController (Identity Inspector).
* VC storybord has all the controlls: View, ScrollView and ImageView along with all their constraints.
* To anable zooming ScrollView's 'max zoom' should be greater than 1 (Attributes Inspector). I used 3 in this demo.
* ImageView, ScrollView, four layout constraints and 'change image' button should be linked to their outlets in `ImageScrollViewController.m`.

### Image constraint item order

For each of the four auto layout constraints between the image and the scroll view: **first item must be image** (and not superview).
