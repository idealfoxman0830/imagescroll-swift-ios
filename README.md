# Image in a scroll view with auto layout

This is a iOS demo app that shows how to use an image in a scroll view with auto layout. It is written in Swift. Image can be panned and zoomed. It is centered and zoomed out initially. Adapts to device orientation change with animation.

Tested in iOS 7.1 and 8.0.

## Things to note

* The job is done with auto layout constraints only.
* On each zoom we update the `constant` values for the constraints to center the image if needed.
* Feel free to contact me if you are stuck (like I was).

## How to copy this control to your project

* In your storyboard 'Use Auto Layout' setting must enabled.
* Copy files `ImageScrollViewController.m` and `ImageScrollViewController.h` into your project.
* Copy Image Scroll View Controller into your storyboard, like this:

## Troubleshooting

Please make sure:

* Your view controller's class is ImageScrollViewController (Identity Inspector).
* Storyboard has all the controls: View, ScrollView and ImageView along with all their constraints.
* To enable zooming ScrollView's 'max zoom' should be greater than 1 (Attributes Inspector). I used 3 in this demo.
* ImageView, ScrollView, four layout constraints and 'change image' button should be linked to their outlets in `ImageScrollViewController.m`.

### Image constraint item order

For each of the four auto layout constraints between the image and the scroll view: **first item must be image** (and not superview).
